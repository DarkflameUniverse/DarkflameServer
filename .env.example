# Full path to the LEGO Universe client
# You should provide the directory which contains the versions and client folder. 
# If you don't a versions and client directory, provide the directory which contains the legouniverse.exe
CLIENT_PATH=/Users/someuser/LEGO Universe
# Define the type of client you are providing
# Possible values: auto, packed and unpacked
# The default value is auto which should work for most usecases.
# With auto the script tries to detect which type of client you are using.
# If you set it to unpacked, you should set CLIENT_PATH to the folder containing legouniverse.exe
# If you set it to packed, you should set CLIENT_PATH to the folder containing the versions and client folder
