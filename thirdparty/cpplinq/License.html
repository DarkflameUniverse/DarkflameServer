               1. Definitions
            </h2>
            <p>
               The terms &quot;reproduce,&quot; &quot;reproduction,&quot; &quot;derivative works,&quot;
               and &quot;distribution&quot; have the same meaning here as under U.S. copyright
               law. A &quot;contribution&quot; is the original software, or any additions or changes
               to the software. A &quot;contributor&quot; is any person that distributes its contribution
               under this license. &quot;Licensed patents&quot; are a contributor's patent claims
               that read directly on its contribution.</p>

               (B) If you bring a patent claim against any contributor over patents that you claim

               (D) If you distribute any portion of the software in source code form, you may do
               so only under this license by including a complete copy of this license with your
               distribution. If you distribute any portion of the software in compiled or object
               code form, you may only do so under a license that complies with this license.
